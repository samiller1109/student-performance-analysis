## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQL (SQLite)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## Key Findings
- Differences in average scores across gender and parental education.
- Lunch programs may correlate with performance differences.
- Overall score distribution shows room for targeted improvement efforts.

## Repository Structure
- `/data`: Raw and cleaned datasets
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `/sql`: SQL queries used for data analysis
- `/visualizations`: Generated plots
